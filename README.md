Web scraping bot

# This bot written to scrape data from a specific website.
Before running the script, you need first to download the html file of the website.
The website may have used dynamic content loading techniques (such as AJAX or JavaScript) that prevent the scraper from accessing the full HTML content of the page.
The website may have implemented anti-scraping measures (such as rate limiting or IP blocking) that prevent the scraper from accessing the page altogether.

Updates, feedback and comments are highly appreciated.

Thank you for reading this.
